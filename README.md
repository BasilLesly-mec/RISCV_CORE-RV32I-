# RISCV_CORE-RV32I-
This repository contains a fully synthesizable RV32I RISC-V processor core implemented in Verilog HDL. The design supports the complete RV32I base integer instruction set and follows the RISC-V ISA specification. It is intended for educational use, FPGA prototyping, and extension toward custom System-on-Chip (SoC) designs.
